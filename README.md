## About

:warning: This is still a WIP project. Any help/contribution/PR is highly appreciated.

---

Our daily lives are full of a constant flow of information, thoughts, feelings.
We feel like time is flying away and we're not in control.

What if, for a short moment, we take control back.
This is where Breathe comes in.
Just settle down for a moment, relax and breathe!

Be in the present moment, that's all that matters.
Simply breathe.
